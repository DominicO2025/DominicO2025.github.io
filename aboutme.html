      <p class="main-text">
        I am a sophomore Computer Science major at Sonoma State University, expecting to graduate in Spring 2028 with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a minor in Electrical Engineering. I am interested in pursuing opportunities in backend or full-stack development, where I can apply my technical skills to build efficient and scalable systems.<br>
I am actively strengthening my programming abilities through both academic coursework and independent projects. These experiences have allowed me to deepen my understanding of problem-solving, software design, and collaborative development.<br>
In addition to my technical growth, I am involved in several campus and community organizations. I am a member of MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement), serve as the Events Coordinator for ASBMB (Association of Biology and Microbiology), and co-founded the Sonoma County Chess Club. Through these roles, I have developed leadership, organization, and communication skills that complement my technical background.<br>
